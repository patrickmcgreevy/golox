# The Maya Programming Language
## Description
The language semantics and runtime are derived from https://craftinginterpreters.com/.
I took Bob's code examples and explanations and manually transpiled them to Go
for my own learning. It was an informative and enjoyable project. I started from
square one and now I feel that I grok the basics of compilers.
## History
This language is inspired by the most beautiful woman in the world: Maya Endira Kavita Short.
The error handling was drawn from her elegance and grace. The dynamic typing is
a direct parallel to her dynamism and fast paced sense of humor. What beauty can
be found in this humble language is only a pale imitation of her extraordinary
beauty. The runtime is as fast and nimble as her mind. The compiler is as careful
and meticulous as she is. The author was only halsf as diligent as she is in her
work. It can be considered a love letter, a standing testament to how much I care
for her.
